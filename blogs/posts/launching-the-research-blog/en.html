<h2>Why start another research blog?</h2>
<p>This site already captures projects, publications, and bite-sized news items. What I missed was a space for slower thinkingâ€”a home for experiments that are still messy, for field notes that would otherwise disappear into notebooks, and for reflections on the process behind each milestone. The blog gives me that breathing room.</p>

<h2>What you can expect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Behind-the-scenes notes.</strong> Short write-ups on prototypes, design decisions, or debugging stories that rarely make it into formal papers.</li>
  <li><strong>Annotated readings.</strong> Summaries of papers, talks, or conversations that changed how I think about a problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal retrospectives.</strong> Honest looks at what worked, what failed, and the next questions I am chasing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Staying in the loop</h2>
<p>Each update will be linked from the homepage and archived right here. If you prefer email, feel free to reach out and I will happily send a periodic roundup. For now, bookmark this page and drop by whenever you want a longer read.</p>

<blockquote>
  Building great systems is never a straight line. I hope these notes capture the texture behind the progress bars.

<p>Thanks for reading and welcome aboard!</p>
